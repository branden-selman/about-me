        <h2>iPhone Facts</h2>

        <p>
          Steve Jobs revolutionized the world by introducing the iPhone, the
          first ever smartphone. As soon as iPhone hit the market, it went on to
          become an instant hit. After so many iterations and introduction of
          newer handsets every year, Appleâ€™s iPhone is becoming popular year
          after year. Today we provide 6 interesting facts about iPhone.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The iPad was the initial motivation for the iPhone. While the iPad
            was being developed, Steve Jobs determined that it was better to
            focus on a phone, with the multi-touch functionality they were
            developing for the tablet. As a result, the iPad was released later
            than the iPhone.
          </li>
          <li>
            Apple originally approached Verizon to partner in the creation and
            release of the iPhone, but Verizon turned Apple down. Cingular (now
            AT&T) agreed to Apple's terms and signed the deal, which included
            allowing the iPhone to display only Apple's logo and not the
            carrier's logo.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any iPhone ad has their advertisements show a time of 9:41, which is
            the time when the big reveal of the iPhone products occurs. The
            company times the big reveal for 40 minutes into the presentation,
            and in order for the ad during the launch to appear in real time it
            shows the estimated time. It used to display the time 9:42.
          </li>
          <li>
            The original design for the iPhone display called for plastic, but
            it was changed to glass after Steve Jobs realized his keys scratched
            the plastic.
          </li>
          <li>
            The retina display on the iPhone is the phone's most expensive
            feature. The next most expensive feature are Qualcomm wireless
            chips.
